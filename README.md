# NYC_Shootings_DS5110
Analysis of shooting data in New York City between 2006 - 2019. Analysis done in R.

Main Goals: 
* Finding if there are any interesting patterns in the data through data visualization and Exploratry Data Analysis.
* Answering whether it is possible to accurtely classify if a shotting is fatal. 
* Determining if other less obvious environmental factors such as Carboon Monoxide have a relationship with shooting incidents.

Main Results: 
* The number of shooting incidents per day follows an exponential decayed distribution.
* The number of shootings follows a similar distribution for each and every year (over months) with them reaching a peak in the summer months of July and/or August.
* Current data allows us only to accurtely classify non-fatality or fatality (but not both). The presence of seemingly useful variables such as the type of gun used, wounded area, and motive might have helped. 
* Carboon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, (log) Sulfur Dioxide, and max temprature all have an effect on the number of shooting indicents! Ozone and preciptation have not been found to have a statistically significant relationship with the number of shotting incidents contrary to what some studies had suggested.
